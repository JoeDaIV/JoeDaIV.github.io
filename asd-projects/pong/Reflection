opens to a screen with a countdown timer
then in 5 secs the game begins
the ball launches in a random direction
either player 1 or 2 will move their paddle to reflect the ball: to do this the keys to press are w and s for player one and up and down arrows for player two
if the ball hits a wall then it bounces away
if the ball hits the paddle then it bounces away
if the ball hits the end wall then it disappears and gives the opposite side a point
the game then sarts over with a 3 sec countdown instead
to end the game one player has to hit 7 points
the only thing thats animated is the ball, paddles, timer, and points
the thing that is static is the directions
